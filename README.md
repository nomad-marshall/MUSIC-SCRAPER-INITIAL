this is my music scraper app built with python, custom tkinter and youtube dlp

INSTRUCTIONS:


before you download, create a credentialed YouTube Data API v3 key from the google cloud console


copy that key into a text file called API_KEY, format it so it looks like: API_KEY=your-api-key-here (without dashes, just paste the credential)



move that file into your local copy directory, rename its extension from .txt to .env


and it should work



current features: can search for youtube videos by title or URL, play, pause, rewind, fast forward the media


coming soon: playlist support, other platforms, more functionality


my end goal is to have spotify, soundcloud and/or bandcamp integration, and the ability to play mixes/playlists


todo list:

-skip button

-stop button (and clear/quit search?)

-ability to play youtube mixes/playlists

-platform dropdown button

-visible timer

-possible mp4 framework

-repackage as .exe

-eventual spotify integration
