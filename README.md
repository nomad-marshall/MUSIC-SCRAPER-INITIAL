this is my music scraper

right now it has very basic funcionality and only works with youtube

my end goal is to have spotify, soundcloud and/or bandcamp integration, and the ability to play mixes/playlists


todo list:

-skip button

-stop button (and clear/quit search?)

-enter key working for search

-ability to play youtube mixes/playlists

-platform dropdown button

-visible timer

-possible mp4 framework

-repackage as .exe

-eventual spotify integration
