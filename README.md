this is my music scraper
right now it has very basic funcionality and only works with youtube

my end goal is to have spotify, soundcloud and/or bandcamp integration, and the ability to play mixes/playlists


todo list:
-platform dropdown button
-visible timer
-possible mp4 framework
-eventual spotify integration
