this is my music scraper app built with python, custom tkinter and youtube dlp


current features: can search for youtube videos by title or URL, play, pause, rewind, fast forward the media


coming soon: playlist support, other platforms, more functionality


my end goal is to have spotify, soundcloud and/or bandcamp integration, and the ability to play mixes/playlists


todo list:

-skip button

-stop button (and clear/quit search?)

-ability to play youtube mixes/playlists

-platform dropdown button

-visible timer

-possible mp4 framework

-repackage as .exe

-eventual spotify integration
